# Planner — orchestrator log

This file is the orchestrator's record of the project: what has been done, what is in flight,
who is doing it, and what comes next. The orchestrator updates it after every delegation and
every verification. Newest log entries go first.

If this file disagrees with the code, the code wins. Fix the file.

## 1. How this project is run

**Orchestrator:** Claude Opus 5.5, xhigh effort. It plans, splits the work into tasks, delegates
them, reviews every result, runs the gates, and keeps this file current. It does not write feature
code itself.

**Coding agents:**

| Agent | How it is invoked | Availability | Good for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sonnet 5.5, medium effort | Claude Code Agent tool | Available | Precise changes inside existing structure; tests; docs |
| Codex (ChatGPT, gpt-5.6-sol) | `codex exec -C <dir> -s workspace-write -o <file> "<prompt>"`. The binary ships inside the VS Code ChatGPT extension and is not on PATH. | Available | Larger self-contained pieces |
| GLM 5.3 / GLM 5.3 Flash | `opencode run -m zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3[-flash] --auto "<msg>"` | **Unavailable until 2026-10-14** (credits) | — |
| opencode free models | `opencode run -m <id> --auto "<msg>"` | Available, **model IDs not yet known** | Mechanical edits |

**Rules for every delegation:**

1. Each delegation is a task on the board (§3) with an ID, an owner and acceptance criteria.
2. An agent gets one narrow task, the files it may touch, and the gates it must pass.
3. A task becomes `DONE` only after the orchestrator has reviewed the diff and run the gates
   itself. An agent saying "done" is not enough.
4. Agents never commit. The orchestrator commits and pushes. The user granted standing
   permission on 2026-10-10, except for hard blocks: force-push, deleting unbacked work,
   SELinux, secrets, or red gates landing on `main`.
5. Shared rules for all agents are in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

**Isolation:** each agent works in its own git worktree.
- Location: `../QRadar-Dash-wt/<task-id>`, on branch `agent/<task-id>`, cut from the integration
  branch.
- The worktree reuses the main checkout's `backend/.venv` through a symlink. Every command needs
  `PYTHONPATH=.`; without it the editable install imports the main checkout's `app`.
- Each agent gets its own test database, `qradar_obs_<task-id>`, on the test server at
  `localhost:5433`. Never run two pytest processes against one database.
- The orchestrator reviews the worktree diff, runs the gates there, then merges the branch into
  the integration branch.

**Branches:**
- `main` stays green.
- Phase B.2 is integrated on `feat/phase-b2`. It merges to `main` once every gate passes.

**Gates:**

- `make lint`
- `make test` (unit)
- `make test-integration`
- `make check` (migration drift)
- `mypy app`: advisory. The baseline is 31 errors; do not regress it.
- Frontend: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`

## 2. Current state (2026-10-10)

**Last commit:** `6f17a73` on 2026-08-03. This is the Phase B first vertical slice, live-validated.

| Work | State |
|---|---|
| Phases 1–3, Phase A | Committed, complete, live-validated |
| Phase B first slice (`WAF_REQUEST_RATE_SPIKE`) | Committed, live-validated 2026-08-03 |
| Phase B.1: collection productionization (migrations 0006–0008) | Complete per [design §28](PHASE-B-WAF-BEHAVIOR.md), **not committed** |
| Phase B.1.5: resilience and scale (migration 0009) | Complete per [design §29](PHASE-B-WAF-BEHAVIOR.md), **not committed** |
| Phase B.2: behavioral detectors (migration 0010) | **Half-built, undocumented, not committed.** See below |

The uncommitted change set spans 35 modified files (+5,341 / −703 lines) and about 33 new files.

**Phase B.2 work in progress, as found:**

| Piece | Present? |
|---|---|
| Migration `0010_waf_behavior_breakdowns` (action map, per-breakdown measurement, ratio sums) | Yes |
| `app/waf/breakdown.py`: fold breakdown searches into per-endpoint counts | Yes, untested |
| Provider `get_waf_breakdown` (base / mock / REST) and collector breakdown searches | Yes, untested |
| Capability specs for the five new detector types | Yes |
| `app/waf/behavior.py`: block / server-error / client-error ratio, client concentration, new-endpoint-access detectors | Written, untested, **not called by the engine** |
| Ratio baseline training (`numerator_sum` / `denominator_sum` written by `app/waf/baseline.py`) | **Missing.** The columns exist and the detectors read them, but nothing writes them. |
| Engine wiring (`app/waf/engine.py` registers only `WAF_REQUEST_RATE_SPIKE`) | **Missing** |
| `WAF_CLIENT_ENDPOINT_FANOUT_SPIKE` | Named only, so that its blocker is published. It has no detector function, by design. |
| Design doc section and README entry | **Missing** |

**Gates measured on 2026-10-10, uncommitted tree:**

- Unit: 1,166 tests, **6 failed**. All six are in `tests/unit/test_detector_capabilities.py::test_status_matrix`, where `EXPECTED_STATUS` has no entry for the B.2 types (`KeyError`).
- Ruff: **7 × E501** — six in `app/waf/behavior.py`, one in `app/cli/waf.py`.
- Not run since 2026-09-16: integration tests, `alembic check`, mypy, frontend gates.

## 3. Task board

Statuses: `TODO`, `IN PROGRESS`, `REVIEW` (agent finished; orchestrator verifying), `DONE`,
`BLOCKED`.

| ID | Task | Owner | Status | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-001 | Get the uncommitted work under version control and pushed | Orchestrator | DONE (changed scope; see the 2026-10-10 log) | Work pushed; `main` unchanged and green |
| T-002 | Write `AGENTS.md`: the shared rules every agent follows | Orchestrator | DONE | Codex and opencode pick it up; Sonnet prompts reference it |
| T-003 | Re-establish the full gate baseline on `feat/phase-b2`: integration tests on the test DB, `make check`, mypy, frontend gates | Orchestrator | IN PROGRESS | Actual output of each gate recorded in the log |
| T-004 | B.2: fix the 7 ruff E501 errors | opencode free model | TODO | `make lint` clean; no behavior change in the diff |
| T-005 | B.2: train ratio baselines. Write `numerator_sum` / `denominator_sum` for the block, server-error and client-error ratio cells through the bulk loaders (§29.11). | Codex | TODO | Unit and integration tests prove pooled sums; the statement count per run stays constant |
| T-006 | B.2: register the `behavior.py` detectors in the WAF engine | Codex or Sonnet | TODO (after T-005) | Each detector runs, persists through the Phase A lifecycle, and honors its declared measurement requirement |
| T-007 | B.2: tests for `breakdown.py`, collector breakdown searches, and `get_waf_breakdown` (mock and REST) | Sonnet | TODO | FAILED, NOT_COLLECTED and truncated breakdowns are covered; unmapped action values never count as allowed |
| T-008 | B.2: unit tests for every `behavior.py` detector guard | Sonnet | TODO | Every INSUFFICIENT_DATA / HEALTHY / anomalous exit is pinned, including INCREASE_ONLY scope |
| T-009 | B.2: set `EXPECTED_STATUS` for the new types (fixes the 6 failing unit tests) | Orchestrator decides the values; agent applies them | TODO (after T-006) | Statuses match what actually runs; no test weakened |
| T-010 | B.2: design doc §30 and README roadmap entry | Sonnet | TODO (last) | Documents what was built, measured and deferred, in the existing doc style |

**Later, not yet scheduled:**

- WAF analyst API and UI (design §27.14–27.15).
- Field-availability pass against a real WAF product. Production onboarding is NO-GO until then.
- Phase A maintenance-history defect (design §28.14, item 4).
- Phase 4 hardening.
- Retire or rewrite `docs/NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT.md`, which still describes Phase 2.

## 5. Log

### 2026-10-10

- **T-001, with a changed scope.** The plan was to split B.1, B.1.5 and B.2 into separate commits.
  That proved unsafe:
  - the three are interleaved in the same files (collector, models, providers, enums, WAF
    engine and baseline);
  - B.2 was started on top of B.1.5 the same evening;
  - no intermediate snapshot exists, in git or in opencode's snapshot store.

  What was done instead:
  - Took a backup ref of the full tree first: `refs/backup/pre-t001-2026-10-10` → `3e4dc45`.
  - Pushed `main` to origin. It held 9 unpushed commits, up to `6f17a73`.
  - Committed the whole snapshot as `7f8bd39` on a new branch, `feat/phase-b2`, and pushed it.
    `main` stays green and unchanged. The branch merges once B.2 is finished and every gate
    passes.
  - Secret scan of the diff before pushing: clean. The only UUIDs are test fixtures; the IPs are
    lab and test data.
- **T-002.** Wrote `AGENTS.md`. Found a trap while setting up worktrees: the virtualenv's editable
  install resolves `app` to the main checkout, so every command now carries `PYTHONPATH=.`.
- **T-003 started.**
  - Test DB `timescale/timescaledb:2.17.2-pg16` is up on `:5433` (tmpfs only, no bind mounts).
  - Created per-agent databases `qradar_obs_t004` … `qradar_obs_t008`.
  - The full suite is running on `qradar_obs_test`.
- **Status assessment.** Last commit `6f17a73` (2026-08-03). B.1 and B.1.5 are complete per the
  design doc but not committed. An undocumented, half-built B.2 was found in the working tree; it
  is inventoried in §2.
- **Gates measured:**
  - Unit tests: 1,166 run, 6 failed (capability status table).
  - Ruff: 7 × E501.
  - Integration and frontend gates not run.
- **Agent tooling checked:**
  - Codex v0.162.0-alpha, inside the VS Code extension, logged in with ChatGPT.
  - opencode v2.0.24. GLM model IDs confirmed: `zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3` and
    `zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3-flash`.
  - Free-model IDs could not be listed headlessly: `opencode models` prints nothing without a TTY.
- **Orchestration model agreed with the user** (§1).
- Created this file.
